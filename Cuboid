A cuboid is a three-dimensional geometric shape that has six rectangular faces, twelve edges, and eight vertices (corners). All angles in a cuboid are right angles, and opposite faces are equal in size and parallel. It is a specific type of rectangular prism where all sides are not necessarily of equal length. The term "cuboid" is often used interchangeably with "rectangular prism," though some use "cuboid" to refer specifically to a rectangular prism with non-square faces.
